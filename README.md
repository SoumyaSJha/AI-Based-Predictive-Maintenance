# AI-Based-Predictive-Maintenance

## Why AI-for-Predictive-Maintenance ?
According to the International Society of Automation, $647 billion is lost globally each year due to downtime from machine failure. Organizations across manufacturing, aerospace, energy, and other industrial sectors are overhauling maintenance processes to minimize costs and improve efficiency. With artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, organizations can apply predictive maintenance to their operation, processing huge amounts of sensor data to detect equipment failure before it happens. Compared to routine-based or time-based preventative maintenance, predictive maintenance gets ahead of the problem and can save a business from costly downtime

## About the Project
Build deep learning models based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict failures in hard drives and Autoencoders to detect anomalies.
