# AI-Based-Predictive-Maintenance

Why AI-for-Predictive-Maintenance ?
According to the International Society of Automation, $647 billion is lost globally each year due to downtime from machine failure. Organizations across manufacturing, aerospace, energy, and other industrial sectors are overhauling maintenance processes to minimize costs and improve efficiency. With artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, organizations can apply predictive maintenance to their operation, processing huge amounts of sensor data to detect equipment failure before it happens. Compared to routine-based or time-based preventative maintenance, predictive maintenance gets ahead of the problem and can save a business from costly downtime

About the Project
Identify anomalies and failures in timeseries data, estimate the remaining useful life of the corresponding parts, and map anomalies to failure conditions.

Build a deep learning model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and create an autoencoder that detects anomalies for predictive maintenance.
